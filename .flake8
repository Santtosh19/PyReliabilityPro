# Set the maximum line length to 88 characters, which is a common modern standard
# (and matches the default for the 'black' code formatter). This helps with
# the "E501 line too long" errors for lines that are between 79 and 88 characters.

# (Optional) You can ignore specific error codes if you have a good reason.
# For example, Black formatter sometimes conflicts with E203 (whitespace before ':').
# Let's add that one in preparation. And W503 (line break before binary operator)
# is often ignored as a newer style prefers the break before the operator.
